#This is a content based Movie Recommender system. 
#I have removed one of the large files - similarity.pkl as it was not getting uploaded. 

# If you want to run this in your system - you have to run the jupyter notebook cells for getting similarity.pkl in your system. 
# Once you have similarity.pkl in your system, you can use it and run Recommend.py to use the recommender system
